# ACPCoreSample

How to run the sample app:

Begin by installing the npm dependencies for the sample app (ensure you have ran `npm install` in the parent directory for the actual module)
`npm install`

To run the app:

`react-native run-ios (For iOS) or you can open ios/ACPCoreSample.xcodeproj and hit run`

`react-native run-android (For Android, be sure to have an emulator running: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline)`

### Troubleshooting

If you're having issues running the sample app, ensure you can at least run a default react native app.

```
react-native init MyReactApp
react-native run-ios or react-native run-android
```
